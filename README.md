# candy_rank
Which is the best feature about a candy? Is it chocolately, peanuty, almondy, fruity or maybe a hard candy?
Based on 538's article (https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/the-ultimate-halloween-candy-power-ranking/), I am ranking the best features that make the ideal candy using a multi-regression model. 

Dataset can be found here:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/candy-power-ranking/candy-data.csv

Binary variables are given for each feature that represent whether or not a feature exists in the candy. Of course, more than one feature may exist in a candy.
For example, a candy can be both peanuty and chocolatey!
